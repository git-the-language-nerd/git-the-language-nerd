### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a language nerd and programmer, specializing in Python. I graduated from Economics and Linguistics worked in Berlin and Cairo between 2017-2022. I am currently doing a Master's in Computational Linguistics, Machine Learning and AI at the University of Potsdam.

Ask me about languages and you're in for a long conversation ;) I love everything languages. I speak German (mother tongue), English (C2), French (C1), Spanish (B2), Arabic (B1), Turkish (B1).
